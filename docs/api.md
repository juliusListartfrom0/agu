# AGU API Contract

AGU exposes a minimal FastAPI surface for basketball video action analysis. It does not implement authentication, RBAC, API gateway behavior, grouping, player profile management, or business database writes.

}
```

Task status also includes `request_id`, `created_at_unix`, and
`updated_at_unix`. Cancellation is cooperative: AGU stops at the next pipeline
progress boundary and preserves `status=cancelled`; a completed/failed task is
not rewritten. `retry` creates a new task from the stored request and is allowed
only for failed or cancelled in-memory tasks. Task requests/results remain
in-memory and are lost after process restart.

`max_runtime_sec` sets a per-request cooperative deadline. When omitted,
`BASKETBALL_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_SEC` is used; `0` disables it. `max_frames`,
`max_segments`, segment bounds, and this deadline form the current resource
budget controls. Long detector/model calls can finish before cancellation or a
deadline is observed.

For running tasks, `progress` is a best-effort integer from 0 to 100. AGU now
updates it at major pipeline stages such as tracker setup, window cropping,
R(2+1)D inference, fusion/VLM verification, identity extraction, segment audit,
and post-processing. It is intended for CLI/UI polling feedback, not as a
durable timing contract; completed and failed tasks still finish at `100`.

## Stable Output Fields

`result.schema_version` versions the stable JSON contract. Additive fields do
not change this value; an incompatible removal or semantic change requires a
new major schema version. `result.pipeline_manifest` records the stage names,
status, elapsed milliseconds, and non-secret execution metadata. Durations are
diagnostic and are not a performance SLA.

`result.records[]` contains one row per player clip.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `player` | integer | Player index in the tracked video |
| `clip_index` | integer | Clip sequence index for that player |
| `start_frame` | integer | First frame covered by the clip |
| `end_frame` | integer | Last frame covered by the clip |
| `r2plus1d` | object | Raw model prediction |
| `motion` | object | Motion feature summary |
| `vlm` | object or null | Optional VLM review result |
| `final` | object | Fused final action decision |

`result.summary` provides aggregate counts:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clip_count` | integer | Total analyzed clips |
| `action_counts` | object | Final action histogram |
| `needs_review_count` | integer | Number of clips marked for review |
| `source_counts` | object | Decision source histogram |

`result.player_identity_features[]` contains local-track identity evidence used
by long-video stitching. `appearance_embedding` is generated by the configured
identity embedding backend. The default backend is
`torchvision_mobilenet_v3_small`; `torchreid_osnet_x0_25` can be enabled when
the optional local `torchreid` package and weights are available, with
`sidecar_hsv_hist` retained as an explicit lightweight fallback.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `player` | integer | Segment-local player index |
| `segment_id` | integer or null | Segment ID when available |
| `local_player_id` | string or null | Segment-local player key |
| `start_frame` / `end_frame` | integer | Feature frame range |
| `first_center` / `last_center` | array | First/last observed bbox centers |
| `appearance_signature` | object | Mean HSV/RGB plus torso luminance and jersey-dark-ratio signature retained for explainability/fallback |
| `appearance_embedding` | array | Model/fallback appearance embedding used for cosine similarity |
| `embedding_model` | string | Embedding source/model identifier |
| `embedding_dim` | integer | Embedding vector length |
| `face_embedding` | array | Optional embedding of OpenCV-detected frontal-face crops; empty when no usable face is visible |
| `face_embedding_model` | string or null | Face detector plus configured embedding backend identifier |
| `face_sample_count` | integer | Number of sampled player crops with a usable frontal face |
| `track_coverage` | number | Fraction of sampled frames with usable boxes |
| `method` | string | Feature extraction method |
| `sampled_boxes` | array | Sampled frame-level boxes used for duplicate-ID conflict and overlap checks |
| `jersey_number_candidates` | array | Optional VLM/OCR jersey-number candidates for this local track |

## Long Video Mode

AGU analyzes videos through overlapped segments by default
(`segmented_analysis=true`). The overlap prevents actions near a segment boundary
from being missed, and global summaries count only the owned time range for each
segment so overlap does not double-count clips. The standard async task envelope
is unchanged, but completed task results include `result.long_video`.

Important request fields:

| `r2plus1d_device` | string or null | Optional R(2+1)D device override: `auto`, `cpu`, `cuda`, `mps`, or `mps_if_available` |

Face identity is configured at service level with `BASKETBALL_FACE_IDENTITY_BACKEND`, `BASKETBALL_FACE_DETECTION_MODEL_PATH`, `BASKETBALL_FACE_RECOGNITION_MODEL_PATH`, and `BASKETBALL_FACE_DETECTION_SCORE_THRESHOLD`. The default `opencv_sface_if_available` backend uses local OpenCV YuNet and SFace ONNX models and falls back to Haar sampling when either model is unavailable.

Official identity deduplication can additionally load a sealed
`agu.face-gallery.v1` asset configured by `BASKETBALL_FACE_GALLERY_PATH`.
Matching uses `BASKETBALL_FACE_GALLERY_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` (default `0.45`)
and `BASKETBALL_FACE_GALLERY_MINIMUM_MARGIN` (default `0.08`). Registered identity
assignment also requires `BASKETBALL_FACE_ENROLLED_MINIMUM_QUALITY` (default
`0.65`); lower-quality track faces remain anonymous even when their centroid
cosine passes. The gallery and
query must use the same SFace model; the best same-team match must clear both
gates and the track samples must pass the existing face-quality gate. A shared
gallery person anchors a canonical ID, different gallery people form a hard
no-merge constraint, and unmatched tracks retain traditional ReID plus an
anonymous ID. Gallery enrollment must be benchmark-disjoint and cannot come
from the same acceptance game's reference highlights or statistics.

SFace output is quality-gated per local track: at least two face samples must form a majority cluster with internal cosine similarity of at least `0.50`. Unstable detections from track-ID switches, back-facing heads, or background people are omitted instead of being averaged into identity evidence. The resulting quality is exposed as `player_identity_features[].face_embedding_quality`.

`result.long_video.segments[]` contains segment-level summary and VLM audit status:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `segment_id` | integer | Segment sequence index |
| `start_sec` / `end_sec` | number | Segment time range |
| `start_frame` / `end_frame` | integer | Segment frame range |
| `player_count` | integer | AGU tracked player count in the segment |
| `summary` | object | Segment-level action/source/review counts |
| `vlm_audit` | object or null | VLM estimate of visible player count and actions |
| `audit_status` | string | `pass`, warning, or failure status |
| `audit_notes` | array | Human-readable mismatch notes |

`result.long_video.players[]` contains segment-local player summaries:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `player_id` | string | Segment-local player key, for example `segment_0:player_3` |
| `global_player_id` | string or null | Conservative cross-segment identity candidate |
| `identity_confidence` | number | Confidence for the global identity candidate |
| `identity_method` | string | Identity stitching method, currently `appearance_continuity_stitch_v2` |
| `identity_evidence` | array | Evidence used for the identity stitch |
| `segments_seen` | integer | Number of segments in which this local track appears |
| `clip_count` | integer | Owned clips counted for this player |
| `action_counts` | object | Final action histogram for this player |
| `needs_review_count` | integer | Player clips marked for review |
| `average_confidence` | number | Average final action confidence |
| `statistics` | object | Estimated points, assists, rebounds, blocks, and steals |

`statistics` includes `status`, `estimated_fields`, and `candidate_fields`.
The current `action_proxy_v1` implementation marks assists as an estimated
field. `shoot` clips are exposed as `shot_attempts` and
`point_candidate_count`; points remain candidate evidence until a made-shot,
free-throw, or scoreboard-linked scoring event is confirmed. Blocks, rebounds,
and steals remain candidate fields until event confirmation is available.

`result.long_video.scoreboard_summary` is populated when
`scoreboard_audit=true` (enabled by CLI `accurate` and `vlm-full` presets). It
contains sampled scoreboard checkpoints plus the latest readable final score:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | boolean | Whether scoreboard audit was requested |
| `status` | string | `ok`, `disabled`, `no_readable_scoreboard`, `inconsistent_scoreboard`, or VLM/error status |
| `final_left_score` / `final_right_score` | integer or null | Latest readable left/right score |
| `final_total_points` | integer or null | Sum of latest readable left/right score |
| `final_time_sec` | number or null | Timestamp of the checkpoint used as final score |
| `checkpoints[]` | array | Independent VLM reads from OpenCV-ranked burst frames and temporal LED fusion crops |

`result.long_video.identity_duplicate_candidates[]` contains conservative
post-stitch duplicate-ID review candidates. These candidates do not rewrite
statistics automatically; they expose evidence for VLM or human confirmation.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `left_global_player_id` / `right_global_player_id` | string | Possible duplicate global IDs |
| `confidence` | number | Merge-review confidence from appearance, color, action, and temporal evidence |
| `status` | string | Candidate status, currently requires VLM or human confirmation |
| `recommended_action` | string | Suggested action, for example `review_merge` |
| `left_local_player_ids` / `right_local_player_ids` | array | Segment-local tracks behind each global ID |
| `evidence` | array | Positive duplicate evidence |
| `conflict_evidence` | array | Hard or soft conflict evidence |

`result.long_video.confirmed_identity_merges[]` echoes confirmed merge
instructions supplied in the request. `result.long_video.merged_players[]`
contains the aggregate player summaries produced from those confirmed merges.
This is a separate audit-safe view: original `players[]` and `records[]` remain
unchanged.

`result.long_video.identity_graph_summary` provides an overview of the review
graph: node count, duplicate candidate count, confirmed merge count, VLM merge
decision count, method, and notes. It is informational and does not mutate
player summaries.

When `vlm_identity_merge_enabled=true`, AGU sends the top
`identity_duplicate_candidates[]` to the configured VLM using labeled LEFT/RIGHT
player crop contact sheets. Each VLM response is recorded in
`result.long_video.identity_merge_decisions[]`. Only available decisions with
`is_same_player=true` and confidence above `vlm_identity_merge_confidence` are
converted into additional `confirmed_identity_merges[]`.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `left_global_player_id` / `right_global_player_id` | string | Reviewed duplicate candidate pair |
| `is_same_player` | boolean | VLM same-player decision |
| `confidence` | number | VLM confidence for the decision |
| `canonical_global_player_id` | string or null | Canonical ID chosen by VLM, constrained to the reviewed pair |
| `merged_global_player_ids` | array | IDs to merge into the canonical ID |
| `reason` | string | VLM rationale |
| `evidence` | array | VLM visual evidence |
| `available` | boolean | Whether VLM returned a usable decision |

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `player_id` | string | Synthetic merged player key, for example `merged:player_004` |
| `global_player_id` | string | Canonical confirmed global player ID |
| `merged_from_global_player_ids` | array | Canonical plus merged global IDs included in the aggregate |
| `merge_confidence` | number | Confidence supplied by the confirmed merge source |
| `merge_evidence` | array | Confirmation and identity evidence retained for audit |
| `action_counts` | object | Aggregated final action histogram |
| `statistics` | object | Aggregated estimated points, assists, rebounds, blocks, and steals |

`statistics` is an action-proxy estimate, not official box-score truth. In the
current model, `shoot` actions are shot-attempt/point candidates rather than
made scores; assists are estimated from `pass` actions. Points, blocks,
rebounds, and steals require event confirmation and should be read from
`result.long_video.event_candidates` or `result.long_video.scoreboard_summary`
until ball/rim/possession/scoreboard confirmation is available.

`result.long_video.event_candidates[]` contains low/medium-confidence event
evidence:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `event_type` | string | `block_candidate`, `rebound_candidate`, or `steal_candidate` |
| `player_id` | string or null | Candidate global player ID when available |
| `segment_id` | integer or null | Segment where the candidate was observed |
| `start_frame` / `end_frame` | integer | Candidate frame range |
| `confidence` | number | Candidate confidence, not official-stat certainty |
| `method` | string | Candidate generation method |
| `status` | string | Confirmation requirement |
| `evidence` | array | Human-readable evidence notes |
| `owner_candidates` | array | Ranked nearby player candidates for actor selection or review |

### Experimental official-stat contracts

`GameEventResponse`, `ReviewDecisionResponse`, `OfficialBoxScoreResponse`, and
`RawOnlyPredictionBundleResponse` are internal experimental contracts and are
not yet added to the public analysis response. They enforce append-only event
revisions, causal relations, accepted-status-only aggregation, score
reconciliation, and a sealed raw-video-only evaluation boundary. The feature is
off by default. Configuring a detector does not by itself make the output
official; ball/rim/court/identity evidence and reconciliation gates must pass.
Fine review decisions support `add` in addition to confirm/revise/reject when
raw evidence contains an extra event absent from the coarse candidates (for
example, a miss, offensive rebound and putback in one coarse window). Added
events are hash-bound to the source bundle, begin at immutable revision 1 and
must provide a complete valid `GameEventResponse` payload in `labels`.

Codex/human-reviewed bundles are annotation artifacts, not AGU predictions.
Autonomous acceptance requires provenance `producer=agu` and
`inference_mode=traditional_cv+vlm`, permits only `vision_confirmed` and
`edge_vlm_confirmed` automatic events, and rejects Codex/human/reference markers
mechanically. The official VLM is bounded to traditional tracking/team
candidates; incomplete labels remain `needs_review`.

Official autonomous configuration uses
`BASKETBALL_OFFICIAL_PLAYER_TRACKING_ENABLED`,
`BASKETBALL_OFFICIAL_PLAYER_TRACKER_CONFIG`, `BASKETBALL_OFFICIAL_VLM_ENABLED`,
`BASKETBALL_OFFICIAL_VLM_CONFIDENCE`, `BASKETBALL_OFFICIAL_VLM_FRAMES`, and
`BASKETBALL_OFFICIAL_VLM_IMAGE_WIDTH`, and
`BASKETBALL_OFFICIAL_VLM_CONTEXT_LENGTH`; use
`BASKETBALL_OFFICIAL_VLM_TIMEOUT` for dense official-event windows.
`BASKETBALL_OFFICIAL_VLM_CONTACT_SHEET` remains an opt-in experiment; the
default sends chronological frames separately.
`BASKETBALL_OFFICIAL_ACTION_OWNER_MODEL_PATH` optionally enables an experimental hash-sealed
traditional action-owner ranker in the two-pass path. Its scores prioritize
which AGU-generated track candidates are overlaid for the actor VLM; they do
not populate `primary_player_id` without VLM confirmation. Model provenance
includes the training-manifest hash, annotation producer, and benchmark-overlap
gate so Codex training annotation cannot be confused with runtime review.
The default is empty; leave-one-video-out training performance alone is not an
integration gate, and an independently sealed raw-video evaluation is required.

Autonomous fusion is fail-closed: a traditional made/missed trajectory cannot
be overwritten by the semantic reviewer, a confirmed make rejects a dependent
rebound, and a VLM three-point label is accepted only with explicit visible
line/feet/beyond-arc evidence. `scripts/build_official_event_candidates.py`
exposes `--shooter-lookback-sec` for temporal actor-candidate bounding.
For official per-player output, pass a sealed face-gallery identity graph and
`--require-face-gallery-identity`. The candidate builder then removes anonymous
player tracks before actor ranking. Jersey OCR and body ReID may propagate an
already enrolled canonical identity, but cannot promote an unregistered track
to an official player. Missing/empty gallery anchors fail closed. The two-pass
actor reviewer also requests a player/referee/non-player role label; a selected
referee is withheld from confirmation, but this VLM role check is only a
secondary precision guard and does not replace enrollment.

`block_candidate` is intentionally conservative: a single block-classified clip
is promoted only when its average confidence is high enough; otherwise AGU keeps
the action record but does not expose it as an event candidate. This avoids
turning isolated R(2+1)D block noise into a box-score event.

When segment VLM audit is available with confident action evidence, AGU also uses
it as negative evidence for `block_candidate`: if the audit does not include a
visible block, block candidates from that segment are suppressed. The underlying
clip-level `records[]` and `summary.action_counts` remain unchanged so reviewers
can still inspect model disagreements.

Each `owner_candidates[]` item contains:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `global_player_id` | string | Candidate event-owner player ID |
| `local_player_ids` | array | Segment-local tracks supporting the candidate |
| `rank` | integer | Rank within the event candidate |
| `score` | number | Deterministic owner score from confidence, temporal proximity, action hints, identity confidence, and support |
| `clip_count` | integer | Nearby clips for the candidate |
| `action_match_count` | integer | Nearby clips whose action matches the event hint set |
| `avg_confidence` | number | Average final action confidence for relevant clips |
| `nearest_frame_gap` | integer | Nearest supporting clip distance from the event center |
| `evidence` | array | Human-readable owner-scoring evidence |

Known MVP boundary: `global_player_id` is a conservative candidate generated
from adjacent segment action, body appearance, torso/jersey luminance, optional
frontal-face evidence, and track continuity. OpenCV Haar face detection is a
local optional sidecar: profiles, occluded faces, and small crops fall back to
clothing/body evidence instead of fabricating face evidence. Duplicate identity
candidates remain review-only until jersey number, VLM, or human confirmation.

Scoreboard audit uses the optional `rapidocr_if_available` backend before VLM
fallback. Install `requirements-ocr.txt` for local offline OCR. Configure
`BASKETBALL_SCOREBOARD_OCR_BACKEND=off|rapidocr|rapidocr_if_available` and
`BASKETBALL_SCOREBOARD_OCR_CONFIDENCE`; OCR candidates still pass the same
burst, cross-anchor, monotonic-score, and clock consistency reconciliation.

## Error Behavior

- Invalid or missing `video_path`: `400`.
- Missing task: `404`.
- Background analysis failure: task status becomes `failed`, with `error` populated.

## Reproducibility Notes

- Task state is in memory and is lost when the process restarts.
- `video_path` must be visible to the AGU process/container.
- By default `video_path` must be under the AGU working directory. Set `BASKETBALL_ALLOWED_VIDEO_ROOTS` to a comma-separated list of additional trusted video directories.
- AGU writes JSON output to `BASKETBALL_OUTPUT_DIR`.
- AGU writes annotated video output to `BASKETBALL_VIDEO_OUTPUT_DIR` when `generate_video=true`.
